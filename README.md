Read Head First Java, Chapters 1-11, 14, 16, 17, and Appendix B. This book will arrive shortly if it’s not there already. After reading each chapter, code the exercise for that chapter from the list below in IntelliJ and push it to GitHub. Send me a link to your repo once you finish all of the exercises:

Chapter 1:
Print the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to 100

Chapter 2:
Create a class that counts how many times you call the method increment() and prints out that number when you call total(). Create a main method that calls increment 5 times and then calls total.

Chapter 3:
Create an array of 5 Rectangles (each with height and width instance variables and an area() method). Find the average area of the rectangles.

Chapter 4:
Create a new version of the Chapter 3 exercise where you pass the height and width into the Rectangle constructor and initialize the instance variables there. Add a perimeter() method to Rectangle. Print the total area of all rectangles. Print the total perimeter of all rectangles.

Chapter 5:
Write a program that chooses a random number between 1 and 100. Then asks the user to enter a guess. If they guess right then tell them they win, otherwise tell them if they guessed too high or low. Keep asking the user to guess until they get the right answer. Use classes to separate the different concerns of this program.

Chapter 6:
Create a new version of the Chapter 5 problem where you also record all of the users guesses and print them out once they guess correctly. Use an ArrayList to store the guesses.

Chapter 7, 8, 9:
Create Orc and Troll classes that implement a Monster interface with takeDamage(int amount), String name(), and int currentHitpoints() methods. Store instances of both classes and store them in an ArrayList. Iterate through the list and make each monster take 10 points of damage. After you have damaged all of the monsters, report the name and current hit points of all monsters.
Orcs are named “Orc” and have 20 initial hitpoints
Trolls are named “Troll”, have 40 hit points and only take half damage

Chapter 10 & 11:
Review OOP terminology from the entire book. You must be able to explain these concepts at a minimum:
Encapsulation
Inheritance 
Polymorphism
The differences between: Interfaces, Abstract classes, and Concrete classes.
Multiple inheritance & the diamond pattern
All 4 protection levels
Exceptions
What static means for methods, variables, and classes
Heap, Garbage Collection, JVM, Compiler, and ByteCode
The difference between objects and classes
